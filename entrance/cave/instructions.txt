	You wander into the dimly lit cave...

	You can't go to far because of how dark it is, but the light creeping in from the
 entrance is enough to illuminate something interesting: a chest! This may be a little cliche,
 but you get the impression there's something valuable inside that you should retrieve.
 However, it lies across a narrow but treacherous gorge, too large to simply jump across.

	Looking around further, you notice a plank of wood laying against one of the walls
 alongside what seems like makeshift bedding, perhaps evidence of some prior inhabitant. The
 plank seems large and sturdy enough to use as a bridge to cross the gorge and get to the
 chest. A lightbulb goes off in your head...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 TIP: The chest contains a clue, but we cannot get it to print to our notepad right now. This is 
      because the program will only do so if a file named 'bridge' exists in the same directory. Thus,
      you will need to create this bridge file to be able to succesfully interact with the chest.
      This requires a new command:

      >> touch filename

      The 'touch' command creates an empty file with whatever name that you choose. In this case, you will
      need to create a file named 'bridge' for the program to work. Try using the command and use 'ls' to
      confirm that the file was created. Then, interact with the chest again and see the result!

 FYI: The acoustics in this cave are great! It's the perfect time to introduce another command: 'echo'.
      Try the following:
     
      >> echo hello
     
      Interesting, right? This command is primarily used in bash scripts (programs that are built with Linux
      commands), but it is certainly a fun one to be aware of.
