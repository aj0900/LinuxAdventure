	You walk through the grand entrance into the great library of OS. The Wizard
	believed that the power of the open-source forces was derived from their
	ability to share information, and this library is a physical testament to
	that point. You notice one of your favorite books laying out on a table:
	"The C Programming Language" by Kernighan and Ritchie. Turning to the other
	direction, you see a reception desk staffed by a man in a brown tunic. This
	must be the Chief Historian of OS, personally appointed by the Wizard himself
	to manage this vast collection and preseve the history of the land. He's certain
	to be aware of a clue, but he's been known to test travelers before disclosing
	it. Looks like you might have to brush up on your history...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	TIP: If you've already tried talking to the Historian, you'll know that he wants
	you to answer his question correctly before giving up the clue. We need to know
	about a certain date, but we can't use a search engine! Luckily, Linux has a handy
	tool for dealing with calendars. Look at the following command:

	>> cal MM YYYY

	The 'cal' command allows us to view calendars for all sorts of different times. Using
	the specified format, you can look up the calendar for a specific month and year. Try
	looking up what day your birthday will be on next year, then figure out how to use this
	command to learn what the Historian wants you to know.
