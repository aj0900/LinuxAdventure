	You look around at a field littered with heaps of rubble. Long ago, this served
	as a place for developers to gather and exchange ideas, but it was reduced to
	pebbles in an attack by Bill Gates, the Wicked Wizard of Proprietary Software.
	You heard that the Wizard of OS placed a hint here in an inscription on a pillar,
	but it's not readily visible amidst all the crumbled rock. You have a feeling
	it's still here, but it must be hidden somewhere. If only you had a way to look
	for hidden objects...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	TIP: In this area, we need to search for something that is hidden. In Linux, files can
	be hidden by placing a period before the file name. For example, consider this command:

	>> touch .hidden

	This command will create a hidden file. Don't believe us? Try it out, then type 'ls'. 
	It's like it's not even there!

	Now, though we may hide files, we still want to be able to see them. To view hidden files
	in a directory, use the following command:

	>> ls -a

	That '-a' is called an option, and it serves as one of many ways to modify Linux commands
	for varied functionality. In this case, it lists all files in a directory, even those
	that would normally be hidden. Many commands support options, including some that we've used
	already. Once you see the hidden file, run it like any other executable (./filename) and
	collect your clue!
