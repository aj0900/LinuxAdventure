	You walk into the fairground. The tattered signage and boarded-up stands suggest
 that this place has been abandoned for a while. Yet, in the distance, you hear a carnival
 tune ringing out...

 As you walk towards it, you identify the source: a classic merry-go-round, still turning as
 if it hasn't noticed the decay around it. You recall some locals mentioning how the Wizard 
 of OS loved merry-go-rounds, as they represent the circular relationship he envisioned 
 between software developers and the open-source community. You have a feeling that you should
 search it for a clue, but it's turning too quickly to investigate. Looks like you'll have to
 find a way to stop it before you can do any detective work...

 TIP: You probably noticed the green file when you listed the contents of this directory. In
      Linux, this denotes an executable, a compiled version of a program that can be run by the 
      computer. Try interacting with the merry-go-round in its current state. To do so, try:

      >> ./merry-go-round

      WARNING: You will notice that the program will never end as it is now! To 'kill' the process,
      press 'CTRL-C' (the CTRL and C button on your keyboard). This command kills a process in Linux,
      which is useful when you find your program getting caught in a loop. 

 TIP: To get the clue, you need to fix the merry-go-round.c program. To get started, use the 'nano' command:

      >> nano merry-go-round.c

      This command opens one of the built-in Linux text editors, and it allows us to, among other things,
      write programs. Open up the merry-go-round.c file with nano to get started and receive further 
      instructions.
