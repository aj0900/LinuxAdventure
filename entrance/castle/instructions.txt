	You enter into a castle, but as you walk in, the drawbridge you took to enter the castle compound
	closes behind you. You make your way to the dungeon and find a prisoner's note. The note contains
	the code needed to lower the drawbridge, but the note is very lengthy and makes no sense. You notice
	the prisoner left the following hint for you to make it easier to find the code:

	"The code for the drawbridge is labeled 'BRIDGE_CODE'!"
	
	Successful retrieval of the code will result in discovery of another clue and an exit from the castle.

	TIP: You probably noticed the green file when you listed the contents of this directory. In
        Linux, this denotes an executable, a compiled version of a program that can be run by the 
        computer. Try interacting with the dungeon in its current state. To do so, try:

        >> ./dungeon

	TIP: To get the clue, you need to fix the dungeon.c program, but in order to fix it, you need to
	search for the drawbridge code in the prisoner-note.txt file. To get started, use the 'cat' command
	to look at the prisoner-note.txt file:
	
	>> cat prisoner-note.txt

	TIP: 'grep' is a command used to find literal strings in a file. Be careful because grep is a case sensitive command:

	>> grep "literal_string" file_name

	It is your job find this code in the note and use the values to initialize the variables a, b , and c.
	Use 'nano' as follows to open the code challenge file and get started:

	>> nano dungeon.c
