 TIP: Need to move backwards? Take advantage of Linux's 'dot' notation to return to where you just were.
      This prior directory, the one our current subdirectory is located in, is called the parent directory.
      It's simple. When you want to return to the parent directory, just type:

      >> cd ..		(Don't include the >>, that's just to indicate that we're using the terminal.)

      Those two periods indicate that we're talking about the parent directory, and using them with the
      cd command will take you back there! This is extremely useful for when you find yourself having to
      constantly navigate back and forth between directories.
