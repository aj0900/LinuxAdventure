Learning Linux is a valuable skill for any programmer, but it can be intimidating to get the hang of the different commands. This text-based game relies on the standard Linux file system structure to flesh out the game world, and the user must wield several of the core Linux commands to get around. By playing our game, the user will become more comfortable with some of the major commands used in Linux while hopefully enjoying themselves a bit along the way.


### TO-DOs:
- Need to come up with a general story (mystery?)
- Decide whether user will have to write their own programs at times

  May make idea of adding their name to text file more difficult since other files will be affected in the commit

### Main Linux Commands to Target:

1. pwd (print working directory)

  User can call if they forget where they are.

2. ls (list contents of current directory)

  User will need to call for every 'room' to see what's around.

3. cd (change directory)

  User will need to call to navigate 'rooms'.

4. cat (copy file to stdout)

  User will need to call to read 'instructions' files.

5.  ./executable (run executable)

  User will need to run smaller programs within certain rooms.

### Others?
- nano/some editor?

  Could have user write small pieces of code.
- touch?

  Similar idea to above
- gcc/cc/some compiler

  User would have to compile any program they write
- alias

  Could use as an example of more complex commands
- git commands

  Possibly let user add name to list and commit to master
