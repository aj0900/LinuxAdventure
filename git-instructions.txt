	Welcome back! We see that you would like to add a message to our "players.txt" file.The very first thing you have to do is sign up for GitHub so you can push the changes back to the master repository. You would have to go to a web browser and go to github.com to do that. After you've made a GitHub account now it's time to create a branch in terminal so you can make changes and then push that command to the master repository. The first command you need is "git checkout -b branch_name". This creates a branch named 'branch_name'. You can use any name you'd like! Now use command"git add players.txt" to add 'players.txt' file to the branch we just created. To add message to 'players.txt' file  you are going to be using the command "git commit -m "Added name"". You can add any message you'd like. Adding your name just makes the most sense in this case. Last thing you have to do is push the change you made to the master repository. You do that by using command "git push --set-upstream origin branch_name" or whatever name you used for the branch and that is it. You have successfully added a message to a file and pushed it to the master repository. Now you can go to terminal to start your adventure! Good Luck!
