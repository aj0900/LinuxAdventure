	collaboration between developers. We'll introduce you to a few commands by having you make an edit to the 
	'players.txt' file located in this directory. Once you're done, you'll have made a contribution to this project!
	
	The first thing you have to do is sign up for GitHub. Since you've gotten to this point, we assume that you've
	already successfully forked and cloned the repo as described in the README. 
	
	Once you've created an account, navigate to the command line and follow these steps:
	
	1. Create a branch using the following command:
	
	>> git checkout -b branch_name.
	
	This creates a branch named 'branch_name'. You can use any name you'd like! 
	
	2. Add your name to 'players.txt'. Use a text editor like 'nano' to open it and make changes like so:
	
	>> nano players.txt
	
	3. Once you've saved your changes, add them to the branch you created with the following command:
	
	>> git add players.txt
	
	4. Commit those changes with the following command:
	
	>> git commit -m "message"
	
	You can add any message you'd like, but make sure it's in quotes! A simple one would be "Added name".
	
	5. Push your changes with the following command, using the same branch_name from before:
	
	>> git push origin branch_name
	
	6. Submit your changes for review. If you go to the GitHub webpage for your repository, you'll see a button
	that says 'Compare & Pull Request'. Click it and submit the request.
	
	Once we accept your change, you'll have successfully contributed to our project! Now, you can move on
	and start your adventure. Good Luck!
