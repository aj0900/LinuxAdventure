	Welcome to the Linux Text Adventure! If you're reading this, you're probably just beginning your journey
 with Linux and the command line.  What an exciting time! Please, don't be stressed. Every Linux whiz had to start
 from the same place you're at right now, and just a little bit of practice can get you up to speed on the basics.

	Let's talk a bit about how this adventure is designed. In Linux, the file system structure is primarily
 separated by different directories. If you're coming from Windows/Mac, this is a lot like the idea of a folder.
 In our adventure, we will leverage this setup in order to build a world in which your journey will take place.

	If you already used the ls command, you're aware of what's inside this directory. One of these things must
 have stood out to you immediately: the one in blue text. This color (in default settings) denotes a subdirectory,
 and this particular subdirectory, called 'entrance', serves as the gateway to our fictional world. 
 
	As you traverse through each area, you'll find more instructions.txt files to interact with. Each one will
 provide more story details as well as information on specific commands you'll have to use to progress. Make sure
 to read the instructions as soon as you enter a new area! To solve the mystery, you will have to complete small
 coding challenges in C that will print letters of the solution to your notepad (located in entrance). Once you
 have collected all 7 clues, you can look at your notepad and see the answer!

	We know you're eager to begin, so here's a few things before you go: the commands you'll need to get started:
   -ls: list directory contents (look around areas)	-cat: print file contents to stdout (read instructions)	
   -cd: change directory (move between areas)		-pwd: print working directory (in case you get lost)

	When you're done, use the skills you've learned to write a message to the 'players.txt' file and get started
with git! Go back to terminal and open git-instuctions.txt using "open' command to find instructions on how to write a
message to the 'players.txt' file.

	Ready? Type 'cd entrance' to move into the entrance directory and begin. Good luck!
